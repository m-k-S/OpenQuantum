## Problem Statement[^fn3]

From a techno-economic perspective, quantum is a nascent and fragile ecosystem. The vast majority of private ventures based on quantum technologies have yet to deliver direct economic benefit, despite immense valuations and funding rounds. 

The current state of the distribution of private capital incentivizes unrealistic timelines â€” when organizations fail to meet these timelines, they may then fail to secure the additional funding required to continue development, leading to stagnation or worse. This has the secondary effect of leading the public to lack trust in the field as a whole, as well as to increase the difficulty for future founders to raise capital. 

The American manufacturing base has faltered and it is imperative that we develop or maintain our technological advantage in 'hard tech' areas such as semiconductor, aerospace, robotics, and quantum. While perhaps not as mature as these other fields, quantum devices are an inevitability and the de-growth of the field domestically would be an opportunity for foreign interests to out-compete the US. 

Quantum engineering has heretofore been an arcane discipline, requiring several years of study and a willingness to take on substantial technical risk relative even to other hard tech areas. Thus, the majority of the workforce within quantum are former academics. This limits the growth of the field as the number of newly-minted PhDs is relatively low and the cost-per-headcount for such individuals is high.

Simultaneously, there is a significant absence of educational programs in the US that provide students with hands-on experience. Entrepreneurial ecosystems in hard tech require high skill early-career labor and these skills are lacking in young American college graduates. Extreme and unprecedented growth in 'Big Tech' has led to a surplus of labor for software positions solving problems abstracted from the real world, but this is unsustainable in the face of slowing growth in Big Tech, heightened geopolitcal tensions, and renewed emphasis on manufacturing.

The OpenQuantum project is founded on the following hypotheses:

1. The growth of American manufacturing for hard tech, including quantum, requires an educated technical workforce and therefore novel educational programs
2. Interest in both the physical sciences and modern manufacturing will increase proportional to the number of opportunities available to students and early-career professionals
3. Open-source hardware and scientific tooling will become an important tool in the acceleration of the development of the next generation of 'hard tech' enterprises

## Value Proposition

OpenQuantum provides open-source kits, educational curricula, and technical documentation for a state-of-the-art platform in quantum engineering. We reduce the price of entry for the control and manipulation of ultracold atoms by almost two orders of magnitude.[^fn1]

### Educational Platform

Currently, we estimate that fewer than 100 similar devices exist in the US[^fn2], and almost all of them are used for scientific research at R1 universities or well-funded ventures. Assuming that any given US research lab advises no more than 5 undergraduates per year, the number of students and young entrepreneurs with access to such technology per-year is fewer than 500. 

This is a fundamental bottleneck on the growth of the field and prevents most students from even being aware of the existence of quantum-based engineering endeavors, much less participating in them. As we work with partner institutions and private companies to onboard them to our platform, we expect that the number of opportunities in the field will increase proportional to the amount by which we have reduced the upfront capital expenditure cost.

Moreover, our educational curricula is designed such that technical educators without domain expertise specifically within quantum will be able to lead upper-class engineering or technical degree students through its fabrication and assembly. This will open the field to a much larger population and provide the private ecosystem with a much-needed technical workforce.

Finally, although our platform is nominally designed for education in quantum engineering, at a practical level, it consists of lessons within optics, digital signal processing, additive manufacturing, and high-vacuum engineering. Students will find that the tools and equipment they learn to use are common among practically all hard tech disciplines. These lessons will generalize far beyond quantum, providing a shorter pipeline to adjacent disciplines like semiconductor, biotech, and chemical engineering. 

### Growth in Quantum Technology

The primary driver of private investment in the field is computing, despite the fact that there are a variety of more near-term viable technologies, most notably in sensing and communication. However, it is more difficult to raise venture capital for the development of these devices, as they still take on significant technical risk & lack clear paths to venture-scalability. This fact, combined with the relatively high upfront capital expenditure required, leads to a disproportionate focus on technologies that can claim to provide a panacea for valuable problems, while using longer timelines to avoid taking accountability for providing evidence for such claims.

By providing a platform that requires little to no specialized manufacturing and abstracting away a substantial portion of the required scientific domain knowledge, we also lower the barrier to entry for technically risky attempts at novel device design for solving near-term practical problems.
